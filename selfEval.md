# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
i actually understand this section much better than others.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I havent found a good method of note taking that is working for me yet. i plan on organizing my notes and using rescources to build my notes leading up to mod1.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I find that i google things first but still have a hard time trying to understand in a non visual setting. I tend to get though a problem when i'm able to talk it out with someone but still struggling with the technical terms of things. i undetstand what i need to do or what is happening but having trouble remembering the steps to execute it.
